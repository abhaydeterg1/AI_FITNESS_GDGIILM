AI Fitness Tracker: Revolutionizing Personalized Fitness  

This AI Fitness Tracker is an innovative project designed to provide real-time exercise tracking and personalized fitness insights using artificial intelligence. The system leverages cutting-edge tools like TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Mediapipe to deliver accurate pose estimation, exercise classification, and repetition counting.  

 Core Features
Real-Time Pose Detection: Detects and tracks body keypoints like elbows, knees, and wrists using pre-trained models such as Mediapipe and MoveNet.  
Exercise Classification: Classifies exercises like squats and push-ups using a custom TensorFlow model trained on pose data.  
Repetition Counting:Tracks motion patterns to count repetitions and provide feedback on exercise form.  
User-Friendly Interface: Displays annotated video feeds with keypoints and repetition counts via a simple web-based frontend.  

Tech Stack 
TensorFlow: Neural networks for pose classification.  
OpenCV: Image and video preprocessing.  
Mediapipe: High-accuracy pose estimation.  
Flask/Django:  Backend for real-time tracking and deployment.  

Deployment
The AI Fitness Tracker can be deployed on web or mobile platforms using TensorFlow Lite for lightweight and optimized performance.  

Future Scope
- Integrating wearable devices for enhanced tracking.  
- Adding advanced feedback on exercise form and performance.  

This project is an ideal starting point for fitness enthusiasts and developers looking to explore AIâ€™s applications in health and wellness.
